# S3 Actions Code Samples
S3 actions code samples demonstrate a subset of S3 actions that can be taken on buckets and objects. \
The objective is to provide S3 code examples for the basic s3 operations to try out with Lyve Cloud so hackathon participants will get up to speed quickly and enable them to build integrated solutions on top of Lyve Cloud.

## The Actions

| Action        | Purpose                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Create Bucket | Create a new S3 bucket             |
| Delete Bucket | Delete an S3 bucket                |
| List Buckets  | List of all S3 buckets             |
| Put Object    | Upload an object to a bucket       |
| Delete Object | Delete an object in a bucket       |
| Get Object    | Download an object from the bucket |
| List Objects  | List objects in a bucket           |

## Prerequisites
* Lyve Cloud Service Account credentials (Access Key, Secret key, and, Endpoint URL).

## Code samples
The same S3 actions are implemented in two different code languages. \
Each code sample can execute these S3 actions from a CLI.
-  [Python](Python/)
-  [Golang](Golang/)
